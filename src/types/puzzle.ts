/**
 * Dungeon Puzzle Mode types (GDD: design/gdd/dungeon-puzzle-mode.md — Appendix:
 * Puzzle Data Schema; §3.2).
 *
 * Static, front-end-only data. A puzzle is one position (FEN, side-to-move = the
 * player) plus an authored `solution`: an alternating list of plies starting with the
 * player's move (even indices) and the scripted opponent reply (odd indices). A
 * well-formed solution has odd length (ends on a player ply). Validity (legal FEN with
 * both kings, fully-legal line, odd length, unique/contiguous order) is enforced by
 * tests/unit/data/puzzles.test.ts.
