# Story 001: FEN Rendering and Position Sync

> **Epic**: Chess Board & Move System
> **Status**: Ready
> **Layer**: Foundation (Core — chess board substrate)
> **Type**: Logic
> **Estimate**: S (2–3 hours)
> **Manifest Version**: 2026-05-29
> **Last Updated**: 2026-05-28

## Context

**GDD**: `design/gdd/chess-board-and-move-system.md`
**Requirement**: `TR-chess-board-001`
*(Requirement text lives in `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` — read fresh at review time)*

**ADR Governing Implementation**: ADR-0009: Chess Board Substrate, vue3-chessboard Integration, Keyboard Model
**ADR Decision Summary**: `ChessBoard.vue` is a thin adapter around `<TheChessboard>` from vue3-chessboard. The `fen` prop drives the chessground position config. Do NOT leak chessground's internal config API (`brushes`, `movable`, `events`, `animation`) to parent components.

**Engine**: Web App — vue3-chessboard ^1.x wrapping chessground 9.x | **Risk**: MEDIUM
**Engine Notes**: vue3-chessboard ^1.x `boardRef` expose pattern confirmed by Sprint 1 spike (ADR-0009). `config.animation.duration` is the animation duration knob — 300ms confirmed by spike. No built-in animation-complete hook; `animationDoneAt` is a timed Promise fallback (pieceMoveAnimationMs + 16ms rAF buffer).

**Control Manifest Rules (Core layer — chess board)**:
- Required: `chess.js is the sole authoritative game state`; `ChessBoard.vue` receives only `fen` / `playerColor` / `disabled` props
- Required: `ChessBoard.vue` is a thin adapter — do NOT leak chessground config API to parents
- Forbidden: Never wrap chess.js instance in `ref()` / `reactive()` / a Pinia ref

## Acceptance Criteria

*From GDD `design/gdd/chess-board-and-move-system.md` — board rendering ACs:*

- [ ] **GIVEN** a valid FEN string is provided, **WHEN** the board mounts, **THEN** all pieces appear on their correct squares within 100ms.
- [ ] **GIVEN** an invalid FEN string is provided, **WHEN** the board mounts, **THEN** the standard starting position is rendered and a `console.error` is logged (no crash).
- [ ] **GIVEN** `playerColor = 'black'`, **WHEN** the board mounts, **THEN** the board displays with Black pieces at the bottom (rank 8 at bottom, a1 at top-right).
- [ ] **GIVEN** the board is in DISABLED state, **WHEN** an external system updates the FEN prop, **THEN** pieces animate to the new position (board still displays updates in replay mode).
- [ ] **GIVEN** a position update arrives during an in-flight piece animation and the new FEN differs from the animation target, **WHEN** the FEN prop changes, **THEN** the in-flight animation is canceled AND a reconciliation animation of `reconcileAnimationMs` (±50ms) runs from the current visual position.

## Implementation Notes

*Derived from ADR-0009 §1 + GDD Core Rules:*

- `ChessBoard.vue` wraps `<TheChessboard>` from `vue3-chessboard`. Pass `fen` as the position config. Listen to `boardCreated` or `boardRef` expose to get the chessground API handle.
- `playerColor` maps to chessground's `orientation` config: `'white'` → `'white'`, `'black'` → `'black'`.
- `disabled` maps to chessground's `movable.color: 'none'` (no pieces movable) + dims own pieces to `disabledPieceOpacity`.
- Invalid FEN detection: attempt to create a `chess.js` instance with the FEN. If it throws, fall back to `new Chess()` (starting position) and call `console.error('ChessBoard: invalid FEN received, falling back to start position', fen)`.
- Position updates: set chessground `fen` via `ground.set({ fen })`. The pending FEN queue depth is **1** (latest wins); drop intermediate updates if animation is in progress.
- `pendingFen` queue: maintain a single `pendingFen: string | null`. If an animation is in progress when a new FEN arrives, store it in `pendingFen`. When animation completes, apply `pendingFen` with the short `reconcileAnimationMs` animation.

## Out of Scope

*Handled by neighbouring stories — do not implement here:*

- [Story 002]: drag-and-drop + tap-tap input handling and `move-made` event emission
- [Story 004]: `squareToRect()` geometry contract
- [Story 005]: keyboard navigation composable
- [Story 006]: visual feedback (check indicator, last-move highlight, reduced-motion)

## QA Test Cases

*Logic story — automated test specs.*

- **AC-1**: Valid FEN renders within 100ms
  - Given: `ChessBoard.vue` mounted with FEN `"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1"` (1.e4 position)
  - When: component mounts
  - Then: the board's piece elements (`.cg-board piece` or equivalent) count equals 32 AND the mount-to-render elapsed time (measured with `performance.now()`) ≤ 100ms
  - Edge cases: FEN with en-passant square, FEN with half-castling rights (`K-k-`)

- **AC-2**: Invalid FEN → starting position
  - Given: `ChessBoard.vue` mounted with FEN `"not-a-fen"`
  - When: component mounts
  - Then: piece count equals 32 (starting position) AND `console.error` was called exactly once with a message containing `"invalid FEN"`
  - Edge cases: empty string `""`, FEN with wrong piece counts

- **AC-3**: Black perspective flip
  - Given: `ChessBoard.vue` mounted with `playerColor="black"` and starting FEN
  - When: board renders
  - Then: the board has `orientation="black"` (or equivalent attribute) AND the a8 square element is visually at the top-left (verify via ARIA label or data attribute)

- **AC-4**: DISABLED mode FEN update animates pieces
  - Given: board in disabled state, FEN = starting position
  - When: FEN prop changes to position after 1.e4
  - Then: `move-made` event does NOT fire AND piece elements update to reflect the new position

- **AC-5**: Reconciliation animation (unit test)
  - Given: a drag animation is 50ms in progress (mock animation timer)
  - When: a new FEN prop arrives
  - Then: `cancelAnimation()` is called AND the reconcile animation timer is `reconcileAnimationMs` (±50ms)
